# Causal-Analysis-and-Inference
Causality has always been a central topic in human thinking and in its various undertakings and activities. It entails that when we know the causes and factors that affect a particular problem, then it is to our interest to study and quantify the interactions and relationships of these factors to their outcome. Thus, if some of these factors change, it will be possible to predict (with the use of the established relationship between causes and effect) the quantitative changes and the effects on their outcome. Such a relationship of causality may have the same form with no (or small) changes in relation to time for physics or biology.
